## Notes ##
Idendity crisis - Who are we still?
* space
* portals
* code
* trusted digital repositories
* we're context
* the information

"In your scope, I am content."

"We should be in charge of the community space."

Big data for libraries isn't that big, but it is really hard to work with. #MARC

Object relational model scales horribly
Object document scales well

write memory
1. propel
2. qubit
3. solr
4. odm

nosql vs. sql
* 4 - 10x faster
* 50-90% less memory

| relational databases scale well | if your data is not hierarchical |
| solr scales well | if you have infinite ram |
| beware of the dogma of sql | nosql is a viable option |
| think sideways | scale out |

big data is less about size, and more about freedom

open source tools + distrubted design = new opportunities
